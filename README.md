# DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP:
**PHASE 0: Project Setup & Planning (1 Day)**
Goal: Setup project skeletons, initialize repos, and ensure dev tools are ready.

Tasks:

 Create GitHub repo: match-tracker-digest

 Setup client/ with Vite + React + Tailwind + RTK

 Setup server/ with Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose)

 Create .env.example, .gitignore, README.md files

 Setup Prettier + ESLint for consistent formatting

 Setup MongoDB Atlas & create base schema folders

**PHASE 1: User Authorization (2–3 Days)**
Goal: User signup/login

Frontend:

 Auth pages (Login/Register)

 Dashboard on login with team selection screen

Backend:

 /api/auth/register, /login routes

 JWT generation & middleware

 User schema: email, password (bcrypt-hashed)

Extras:

 Protect routes using JWT on frontend, if unauthorized redirect to home/dashboard

**PHASE 2: Team Fixture & Match Pages (3–4 Days)**
Goal: Fetch and display upcoming/past fixtures per favorite team

Frontend:

 Team-specific page: /team/:id

 Display upcoming 7–10 matches

 Display last 5 matches (score, result, date)

Backend:

 /api/fixtures/:teamId and /api/results/:teamId

 Use Cheerio or API to get data (via helper modules)

 Store daily-scraped data in fixtures, results collections

Cron Jobs:

 Daily scrape: update fixtures & results

 Job logs: console.log('Fixtures updated!') for sanity

**PHASE 3: Live Score & Digest Generation (4–5 Days)**
Goal: Show live scores via polling and generate match digests

Frontend:

 Show “Live” badge with countdown/timer

 Poll every 30–60s (configurable)

 Match Digest card: summary of team’s match today

Backend:

 /api/live/:teamId — fetch live data (poll from API/scrape)

 /api/digest/:teamId/:date — generate summary string

 Store live match in liveMatches with timestamps

Cron:

 Daily digest summary script, stored per user

 Consider future upgrade to send email (just log for now)

**PHASE 4: Lineups, Notifications & Trends (4–5 Days)**
Goal: Show lineups, today’s match dashboard, and trend graphs

Frontend:

 /dashboard: Show:

Today’s fixtures

Ongoing matches

Important upcoming fixtures

 /team/:id/trends: Show win/draw/loss graph (Recharts)

Backend:

 /api/lineup/:matchId — scrape predicted/actual lineups

 /api/notifications/:userId

 /api/trends/:teamId — return last 10 match outcomes

Cron:

 Store historical match outcomes for graph data

 Update lineups 2 hrs before match (scraping)

**PHASE 5: UX Polish + Extras (2–3 Days)**
Goal: Final polish, mobile UI, shareable links, bookmarks, etc.

Tasks:

 Dark mode toggle (RTK + localStorage)

 Bookmark match toggle (store in user schema)

 Skeleton loaders during fetch

 Copy/share match digest using navigator API

 Fully responsive UI + mobile navigation bar

**PHASE 6: Deployment & QA (1–2 Days)**
Goal: Host full stack and test in production

Deployment:

 Deploy frontend on Vercel

 Deploy backend on Render

 Setup environment variables (REACT_APP_API_BASE, etc.)

 Connect to MongoDB Atlas

Testing:

 Manual flow testing: auth → team select → dashboard → digest

 Test API rate limits (if scraping, add backoff/retry logic)

 Add error boundaries (React) and 404 handling

# OPTIONAL: Future Enhancements
Email digests:	Send user-specific digest via email (using nodemailer + cron)

Leaderboard:	See which teams have most wins in last 10 games

Chrome extension:	Show today’s fixtures in a popup

Push notifications:	Using service workers or PWA support
